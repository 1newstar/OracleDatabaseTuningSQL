# OracleDatabaseTuningSQL

These are the SQL scripts that Bobby Durrett uses for Oracle
database performance tuning.

These scripts are designed to be run through Oracle's sqlplus utility.

So, if you have a script called example.sql you would run it like this in
sqlplus:

sqlplus myuser/mypassword@mydatabase < example.sql
